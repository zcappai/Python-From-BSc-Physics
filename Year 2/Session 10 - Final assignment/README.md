# Quantum Mechanical problem of a Particle in an Infinite Square Well

In this project, I solved the quantum mechanical problem of the particle in the infinite square well by using the 4<sup>th</sup> order Runge-Kutta method.

This consists of several main parts:
1. Finding the ground state energy
2. Finding and plotting the ground state wavefunction
3. Finding and plotting higher energy states

Then, I solved differently shaped infinite potential wells, such as the harmonic potential, the finite square well and the potential step.
