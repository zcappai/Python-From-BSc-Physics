Therefore the leading diagonal is slightly different in that 2 new 1D arrays are created, one from 1 to 25 and another from 2 to 26. These 2 arrays are summed together and subsequently diagonalised, creating the required leading diagonal, as shown when commenting in 2nd set of code.

    "In the code cell above the angular frequency is plotted against the mode number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially for the 1st instance, as the mode number increases, the angular frequency increases linearly. However the linear relationship breaks down at approximately mode number 15, and the rate of angular frequency increase, decreases and appears to plateau after mode number 25 to an angular frequency of about 2 rad/s. The angular frequency is proportional to the square root of the corrpesonding eigenvalue. In the 1st instance, the spring constant is the same, however eigenvalues are increasing for each successive mode. This suggests that the spring constant, though being the same for each individual spring, changes due to the other springs when in the system of springs and beads. As the mode number increases past 25, the oscillations do not increase in angular frequency because the oscillations of beads oppose and cancel out the oscillations of other beads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially for the 2nd instance, as the mode number increases, the angular frequency increases linearly. However the linear relationship breaks down at approximately mode number 15, and the rate of angular frequency increase, increases. Therefore the spring constant of a spring due to other springs increases, which is shown by the increase in eigenvalues for increased mode number. This suggests that despite the spring constant increasing linearly for each successive spring, the angular frequency increases and does't plateau, unlike the angular frequency for the 1st instance where each individual spring constant is the same. This may be because as individual spring constant increase with an increase number of springs, the newly added springs act more like stationary points to which the earlier springs with lower spring constants are attached."

    "1st instance: In the lowest mode, the maximum displacement is for the middle bead of the system. For the 2nd lowest mode, the maximum occurs for approximately beads number 8 and 19. Bead number 12/13 has now displacement for the 2nd lowest mode, suggesting that it is a node as the progressive wave cancels out at that point. The maxima are all antinodes. For the 3rd lowest mode, the antinode of the stationary wave is at about bead number 4, 14 and 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "2nd instance: In the lowest mode, the maximum displacement is approximately with bead 5 and then decreases at a linear rate. The 2nd lowest mode has a maximum at about beads number 2 and 15, and the 3rd lowest mode has a maximum at bead numbers 3, 8 and 19. Based on the shapes of the graphs for the 2nd instance, I do not think that a stationary wave can be formed when the spring constant of each successive spring is linearly increasing."
