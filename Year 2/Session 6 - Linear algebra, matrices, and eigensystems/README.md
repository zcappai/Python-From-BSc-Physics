# Calculating Normal Modes of Vibration

In this program, I calculated the normal modes of vibration of a system of N beads connected by N+1 Hookean springs to fixed end points.

This was done by first constructing a matrix K, which represented the spring constant of the combined system. Then, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the K matrix are calculated, followed by calculating the angular frequencies for each eigenvalue. The angular frequency is plotted as a function of the mode number.

The bead displacement is plotted against the bead number for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> lowest normal modes of vibration.
