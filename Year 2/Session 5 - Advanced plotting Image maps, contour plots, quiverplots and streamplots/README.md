# Advanced methods of plotting data in Python

In this program, I explored different methods of plotting data such as through density plots to map images, contour plotting and vector field plotting.

The vector plotting was done in 2 ways:
1. Quiver plot
2. Stream plot

At the end of the file, I plotted the electric field structure around 2 point charges of equal but opposite charge. This was followed by adding a 3<sup>rd</sup> charge to the plot to see how the electric field lines changed.
