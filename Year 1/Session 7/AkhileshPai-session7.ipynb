    "# Constructing and Analysing the Crystalline Structure of Sodium Chloride #\n",
    "In this notebook I will be creating and analysing the crystalline structure of the ionic compound, Sodium Chloride (NaCl). I shall start by importing the relevant coding packages, including certain libraries from the visual python 3D graphics module, in order to create models of ionic lattices. Furthermore, I will be considering the electrical potential between ions in the structure, as well as the total potential felt by the central atom due to every other atom, which can be done by first calculating the Madelung sum and verifying whether it is a good approximation of an infinite crystal, containing an infinite number of ions."

    "Upon changing L to 100 and running, the code took approximately 30 seconds to output the result for the Madelung sum. The 2 values, one for L = 100 and the other for L = $ \\infty{} $, are very similar because to 4 significant figures they are -1.742 for L = 100 and L = -1.748 for L = $ \\infty{} $. Though the results are very similar, this is a very inefficient way of calculating the Madelung sum, this is because in order to obtain more accurate values, the value of L must be increased, however this will greatly increase the run time of the code. Usually NaCl lattices contain billions of ions, which would increase the run time for the code to a point at which it becomes pointless using this method."
