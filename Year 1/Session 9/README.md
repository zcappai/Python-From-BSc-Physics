# Session 9

This program models planetary orbits using Newton's Laws of Gravitation.

The base of the program consists of an animation of a planet orbiting a star.

Then, there are 3 modifications to the code:
1. Adding an arrow to the planet showing the direction of the gravitational force on the planet due to the star.
2. Adding a moon orbiting the planet, while the planet is orbiting the star.
3. Adding a 2<sup>nd</sup> planet that interacts gravitationally with the planet and the star.
