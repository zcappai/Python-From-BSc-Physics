# Session 8

This program uses classical mechanics to simulate projectile motion in the form of an animation.

The program takes 2 inputs:
* Initial angle in degrees
* Initial speed in metres per second

NOTE: To view this animation, you must first install VPython through the Anaconda Prompt by using the command "pip install vpython". Then, within the file in Jupyter Notebooks, you must use the "Python 3" kernel. Otherwise, you will be presented with error messages.
