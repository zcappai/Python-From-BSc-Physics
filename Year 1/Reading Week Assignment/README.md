# Calculating Charge-to-Mass Ratio Of An Electron Using A Magnetic Field

This program calculates the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron in a magnetic field.

The charge-to-mass ratio is calculated by:
1. Importing and plotting, with error bars, experimental data about the radius of the electron's path vs the voltage at the specific radius.
2. Plotting an unweighted least-squares fit line onto the same graph.
3. Plotting an weighted line of best fit onto the same graph.
4. For each of the lines of best fit, the charge-to-mass ratio is calculated using the gradient of the line of best fit and the magnetic field strength.
